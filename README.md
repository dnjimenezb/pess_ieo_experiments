## Introduction

The recent interest in contextual optimization problems, where randomness is associated with 
side information, has led to two primary strategies for formulation and solution. The first, 
estimate-then-optimize, separates the estimation of the problem's parameters from the 
optimization process. The second, decision-focused optimization, integrates the optimization 
problem's structure directly into the prediction procedure. In this work, we propose a 
pessimistic bilevel approach for solving general decision-focused formulations of 
combinatorial optimization problems. Our method solves an  $\epsilon$-approximation of the 
pessimistic bilevel problem using a specialized cut generation algorithm. We benchmark its 
performance on the 0-1 knapsack problem against estimate-then-optimize and decision-focused 
methods, including the popular SPO+ approach. Computational experiments highlight the proposed 
method's advantages, particularly in reducing out-of-sample regret.

## Instructions

Experiments consist of two main parts: computing IEO predictors and performing out-of-sample testing.

### Computing IEO predictors

Experiments can be run from the root folder by executing the script `solve_ieo.py`, using the commands listed below. Please note that running all 
the experiments presented in the paper may take a considerable amount of time. Running this script also computes linear regression and SPO+ predictors.

#### Parameters
- `--n_items`: Number of items in the knapsack instance. Choose 10 or 20.
- `--n_samples`: Number of samples used in the predictor computation. Choose 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 (only for the case with 10 items). Several values can be passed.
- `--method`: Method used to solve the pessimistic IEO computation. Select either bc (branch-and-cut) or ccg (column-and-constraint generation).
- `--timelimit`: Maximum runtime (in seconds) for each instance.

ðŸ“Œ Example

Perform the pessimistic IEO predictor computation for the knapsack instances with 10 items, from 100 to 500 training samples, 
using the branch-and-cut algorithm with a time limit of 1000 seconds.

```bash
python ./python/solve_ieo.py --n_items 10 --n_samples 100 200 300 400 500 --method bc --timelimit 1000
```

### Performing out-of-sample tests

Experiments can be run from the root folder by executing the script `out_of_sample_tests.py`, using the commands listed below. 
Notice that predictors should be already computed and saved in the folder `output\b_matrices`, for the desired values of
knapsack items and training samples. To generate the boxplots charts, use `gen_plot.py`.

#### Parameters
- `--n_items`: Number of items in the knapsack instance. Choose 10 or 20.
- `--ns_train`: Number of samples used in the predictor computation. Choose 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 (only for the case with 10 items). Several values can be passed.
- `--ns_test`: Number of samples to be used in the out-of-sample testing.

ðŸ“Œ Example

Perform out-of-sample tests for the knapsack instances with 10 items, for the 100 - 500 training samples cases, using 1000 testing samples.
Then, generate the boxplot chart for the previous case.

```bash
python ./python/out_of_sample_tests.py --n_items 10 --ns_train 100 200 300 400 500 --ns_test 1000
python ./python/gen_plot.py --n_items 10
```
